Created in 2013, we are a research network dedicated to fostering collaboration and promotion of internationally competitive research in the fields of epigenetics, chromatin structure and gene regulation applied to basic and clinically relevant problems.

The core of EpiCoN currently includes seven research groups from the Departments of Molecular Biology, Medical Biosciences, Physics, and Medical and Translational Biology.


Our activities:
* EpiCon days. 1-2 scientific meetings per year.
* Journal Clubs.
* PI meeting rounds. Tailored discussions based on individual PIâ€™s needs.
* Career development.
* Research plans and ideas.
* Joint research proposals and manuscripts
* Seminars with local and invited speakers.
* Provide a core for organizing conferences, e.g., Epichrom meeting 2020.
